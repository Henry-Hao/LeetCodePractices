# 135. Candy

There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

## Solution 
使用一个数组nums储存每个孩子应该被分到的candy数量  
初始值全为1  
自左向右检查nums后再从右向左检查nums  
Example:  
ratings = [1,0,2,1,0,2,1]
nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]  
从左向右遍历,如果ratings[i] > ratings[i-1], nums[i] = nums[i-1] + 1  
nums = [1,1,2,1,1,2,1]  
从右向左遍历,如果ratings[i] > ratings[i+1] 并且 nums[i] <= nums[i+1], nums[i] = nums[i+1] + 1  
nums = [2,1,3,2,1,2,1]

``` java
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int size = ratings.length;
        int[] nums = new int[size];
        for(int i = 0; i < size; i++)
            nums[i] = 1;
        
        for(int i = 1; i < size; i++){
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i-1])
                nums[i] = nums[i-1] + 1;
        }
        
        for(int i = size - 2; i >= 0; i--){
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i+1] && nums[i] <= nums[i+1])
                nums[i] = nums[i+1] + 1;
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        for(int n : nums)
            result += n;
        return result;
    }
}
```
