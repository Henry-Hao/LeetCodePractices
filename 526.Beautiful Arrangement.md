# 526. Beautiful Arrangement
Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:

The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?  

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: 2

Explanation: 

The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
```
Note:
N is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.


## Solution
Example:
N = 6
m:
1:[1,2,3,4,5,6]
2:[1,2,4,6]
3:[1,3,6]
4:[1,2,4]
5:[1,5]
6:[1,2,3,6]

创建一个matrix,m[i]中储存可以被i整除的数或者可以整除i的数
使用dfs遍历从1到N,找出不重复的路径
``` java
class Solution {
    public int countArrangement(int N) {
        Set<Integer> result = new HashSet<>();
        List<Set<Integer>> results = new ArrayList<>();
        int[][] m = new int[N][N];
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < N; j++){
                if((i+1) % (j+1) == 0 || (j+1) % (i+1) == 0)
                    m[i][j] = j+1;
                else
                    m[i][j] = -1;
            }
        }
        
        helper(m,0,result,results);
        return results.size();
        
    }
    
    public void helper(int[][] m, int level, Set<Integer> result, List<Set<Integer>> results){
        if(level == m.length){
            results.add(result);
            return;
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < m[level].length; i++){
            if(m[level][i] != -1 && !result.contains(m[level][i])){
                Set<Integer> tmp = new HashSet<>(result);
                tmp.add(m[level][i]);
                helper(m, level + 1, tmp, results);
            }
        }
            
    }
}
```
